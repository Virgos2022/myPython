Welcome !!!!
This is a game based on the game which we all used to play in our childhood days . Yes!! this is Bollywood game in which we used to provide a name of a film and the player had to guess the letters in that movie's name in limited attempts.
I have made a different random word generator package which i have imported in game.py . 
In the package there is a list which u can change as per ur choice and all the work will be left on the code .
So run it and ENJOY :D
